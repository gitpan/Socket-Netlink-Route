Revision history for Socket-Netlink-Route

0.05    BUGFIXES:
         * s/set_nlattrs/change_nlattrs/ since that's the actual method name

0.04    CHANGES:
         * Renamed 'mac' to 'lladdr'
         * Implemented nlattr packing functions
         * Updated for IO::Socket::Netlink 0.04

0.03    CHANGES:
         * Use rtnl_link_stats rather than net_device_stats, because that's
           the correct structure
         * Prefer to obtain inet_ntop from Socket rather than Socket6
         * Optionally skip IFALIAS because older libcs/kernels don't have it

0.02    ADDITIONS:
         * Direct accessors for IfaddrMsg's prefix and RtMsg's src and dst
         * RTM_{NEW,DEL,GET}NEIGH and associated message class
         * Multicast group constants

        CHANGES:
         * Don't hard-depend on Socket6; just use it if it's available

        BUGFIXES:
         * Declare build_requires ExtUtils::H2PM

0.01    First version, released on an unsuspecting world.

=head1 NAME

C<Socket::Netlink::Route> - interface to Linux's C<NETLINK_ROUTE> netlink
socket protocol

=head1 DESCRIPTION

This module contains the low-level constants and structure handling functions
required to use the C<NETLINK_ROUTE> protocol of Linux's C<PF_NETLINK> socket
family. It is suggested to use the high-level object interface to this
protocol instead; see L<IO::Socket::Netlink::Route>.

For more information, see the Linux kernel documentation about the
C<NETLINK_ROUTE> protocol family in F<rtnetlink(7)>

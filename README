NAME
    "Socket::Netlink::Route" - interface to Linux's "NETLINK_ROUTE" netlink
    socket protocol

DESCRIPTION
    This module contains the low-level constants and structure handling
    functions required to use the "NETLINK_ROUTE" protocol of Linux's
    "PF_NETLINK" socket family. It is suggested to use the high-level object
    interface to this protocol instead; see IO::Socket::Netlink::Route.

    For more information, see the Linux kernel documentation about the
    "NETLINK_ROUTE" protcol family in rtnetlink(7)

     $ man 7 rtnetlink
